Create a token
The goal of this Project is "Initiate a Token" which highlights its functionality for generating tokens in Solidity language through state variables, and subsequently, performing different actions on these tokens such as generating and destroying them.

This Solidity project involves creating a smart contract capable of performing various operations. The contract includes key details such as the name, abbreviation, and total quantity of the token. It also maps each sender's account address to their account balance. The project includes a minting function that increases both the total token supply and the sender's account balance by a specified amount. Additionally, a burning function is available to decrease both the total token supply and the sender's account balance by a specified amount, provided the sender has sufficient funds.
 
To develop a similar project, the following functionalities should be implemented:

Public Variables: The contract should contain public variables to store information about your coin, including its name, abbreviation, and total supply.
Address to Balance Mapping: There should be a mapping from addresses to account balances (address => uint).
Functions
Minting Function: This function should accept an address and a value, add the value to the total supply, and increase the account balance of the specified address by that value.
Burning Function: This function should accept an address and a value, decrease the total supply, and reduce the account balance of the specified address by that value. The function should also ensure that the account balance is greater than or equal to the amount to be burned.
Getting Started
Installation
You can download the program by clicking the code button and selecting the option to download it as a zip file. Alternatively, if you want to use it in your own project, you can fork the repository to your GitHub for further editing.

Executing the Program
Download the file and open it in Remix IDE.
Compile the code and deploy the contract.
Add your account address and the value by which you want to increase the balance in the mint function.
Click on the mint function to see the updated total amount.
Use the burn function similarly to decrease the balance.
You can also modify the token name, abbreviation, and total supply as needed.
